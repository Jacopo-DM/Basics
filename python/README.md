## `base.py`

A python file used as template for all other python programs written by the author.

It also contains information at the bottom (for easy recollection) regarding how to save a python requirement.txt file as well as preferred syntax style.

## `data.py`

Contains common "dataclasses" used by the author in his python programs (mostly aesthetic).

## `setup.py`

This performs a series of checks to ensure that the python environment is setup correctly for the programs in a given directory (it also sets up the logging module).
