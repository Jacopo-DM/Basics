# Python

## README.md

This file.

## base.py

A python file used as template for all other python programs written by JMDM.
It also contains information at the bottom (for easy recollection) regarding how to save a python requirement.txt file as well as preferred syntax style.

## data.py

Contains common "dataclasses" used by JMDM in his python programs (mostly aesthetic).

## setup.py

This performs a series of checks to ensure that the python environment is setup correctly for the programs in a given directory (it also sets up the logging module).
